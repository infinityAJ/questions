>## Answer each question with a code solution.
1. Create a list with 5 elements and print it.
1. Print `2` from the following list (use index)-
    ```py
    nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    ```
1. Print `11` from the following list (use index)-
    ```py
    nums = [
        [6, 10, 8, 14],
        [5, 13, 11, 9]
    ]
    ```
1. Add the following lists together and then print the results-
    ```py
    list1 = ['python','is','used','in']
    list2 = ['almost','every','field']
    ```
1. Replace the elements of this list so that this list contains only `7`'s, print the list before and after changes-
    ```py
    sevens = [7, 7, 3, 7, 5, 7]
    ```
1. Create a tuple with 5 elements and print it.
1. Print `4` from the following tuple:
    ```py
    nums = (7, 4, 2)
    ```
1. Print `7` from the following tuple:
    ```py
    items = ('even', (2, 4, 6), 'odd', 7.839, ('seven', 7, 11))
    ```
1. Unpack the following tuple in variables and then print both variables.
    ```py
    tuple = ('Hello', 'World')
    ```
1. Demonstrate swapping of two numbers using tuple and tuple unpacking.
1. Demonstrate sorting of a list using set.
1. Use a set to print unique elements from the following list-
    ```py
    nums = [1, 4, 2 ,5, 4, 3, 6, 1]
    ```
1. perform said operations on the following set, print the set after every step.
    ```py
    nums = {1, 3, 4, 5, 7}
    ```
    ### operations to perform
    - add 2 using add method
    - remove 7 using remove method
    - add 6 using add method
1. calculate union, intersection and difference of following sets-
    ```py
    set1 = {1, 2, 3, 4}
    set2 = {3, 4, 5, 6}
    ```
1. count the unique letters used in `python is a great language` using sets.
1. print the value for `two` in the following dictionary-
    ```py
    dict1 = {
        'one': 1,
        'two': 2,
        'three': 3,
        'four': 4
    }
    ```
1. print all the keys of the dictionary from the previous question
1. print all the values of the dictionary from the question no. 16
1. create a dictionary for 10 numbers like the dictionary in question no. 16 and output the number in words for integer user input.
1. create a dictionary using the function `dict`.
1. create an empty dictionary and fill the dictionary using the following lists-
    ```py
    keys = ['Python', 'Java', 'C', 'C++', 'Basic']
    values = [6, 4, 1, 3, 5]
    ```
1. convert the following list into a tuple and unpack it in diff variables-
    ```py
    items = [56, 'hello', {7, 8, 9}, ['p', 'y', 3.9]]
    ```
1. create an empty set and fill the set using the following list, print the set after each insertion-
    ```py
    nums = [1, 2, 4, 2, 4, 1, 2]
    ```
1. create a dictionary and store a list, string, integer and float in it.
1. create a nested dictionary and print it.
