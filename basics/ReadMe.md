1. print `Hello world!`.
1. take any user input and print it.
1. print the sum of `97` and `63`.
1. print the sum of two integer input.
1. print the result of dividing user input from `2`.
1. determine whether the value of `x` is greater or less than five, `x = 10`
1. determine if `x` is even, `x = 11`
1. determine if `x` is odd, `x = 15`
1. check if integer input by user is an odd number. print `number is odd` if it's odd, print `number is even` otherwise.
1. ask user to enter a number (negative or positive)
    + if the number is negative, print `smaller than 0`
    + if the number is positive, print `greater than 0`
    + otherwise, print `number is 0`
1. print `10` even numbers using a **for loop**.
1. print the table of `5` using **while loop**.
1. print `10` odd numbers using **while loop**.
1. print each character of `S` in a different line using **for loop**, `S = 'Hello'`
1. print the following pattern using **for loop** -
    ```
    *
    **
    ***
    ****
    *****
    ```
1. print the `n` even numbers using **for loop** or **while loop**, `n` is user input.
1. ask user for a string input, then print each character on a seperate line.
1. print the table of number entered by user.
1. print the number of characters in user input. (count the characters using a loop)
1. print the sum of all the even numbers from 0 to 20
1. take a user input
    - if it's an even number check if it's greater then 5
    - if it's odd number check if it's divisible by 3
1. print each word's length in this list: <br> `words = ['hello', 'python', 'list', 'for']`
1. In addition to previous question, print the sum of length of all words.
1. for every number from 0 to 20, check-
    - if the number is divisible by 2, print `good number`
    - if the number is divisible by 3, print `bad number`
    - in any other case, print `confusing number`
1. print the following pattern using a loop:
    ```
        *
       ***
      *****
     *******
    *********
    ```
